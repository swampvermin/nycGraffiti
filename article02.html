Throughout early 2024, New York Governor Kathy Hochul has pushed for the expansion of the definition of what constitutes a hate crime in order to include “hate” graffiti. The push also calls for increasing low-level misdemeanors and low-level felonies into more serious high level charges if motivated by hate based on race, religion, gender, and things of similar nature. This comes after increased vandalism related crimes targeted toward Jewish-owned businesses [6]. While protecting the rights and safety of citizens should always be the government’s priority, a gray area emerges of what a court may decide constitutes “hate” graffiti. Could pro-palenstinain graffiti eventually be regarded as a hate crime or is it a form of protest? <br><br>

Although I appreciate graffiti for its artistic qualities, I recognize that it is a criminal act. It tends to go unreported and is often viewed as an acceptable form of street art, but it is not a victimless crime. In 2002, it was reported that graffiti cost the public $12 billion a year to clean up in the United States [7]. My grandfather faced a constant battle against graffiti made by local gangs on his house and had to invest time and money into having it covered up. Along Canal Street, many business owners have given up the fight against graffiti and let their storefronts become covered.  <br><br>

While its presence may raise moral questions depending on the context, I still admire graffiti as an art form. I respect the exclusivity of graffiti. It's not a skill one casually picks up like drawing. Rather, it demands real-world experimentation and often entails risks. As an art form, it challenges conventional boundaries and commands attention and reaction. Through my exploration of New York City and this project, I've come to appreciate graffiti as a tool for rebellion and resistance against oppression, often reflecting society's cultural consciousness. While vandalism of public spaces costs taxpayers money, I struggle to muster anger towards it. Campaigns to eradicate graffiti often feel contrived and fail to acknowledge its cultural significance, sometimes detracting from the city's aesthetic appeal. Graffiti, like other forms of street art, adds a textured layer to urban life and fosters a sense of connection to society, even if unintentionally.
